<h2><a name="addressing-deserialization-vulnerabilities">Addressing Deserialization Vulnerabilities</a></h2>

<p>An application that accepts untrusted data and deserializes it
is vulnerable to attacks. You can create filters to screen
incoming streams of serialized objects before they are
deserialized.</p>


<h3><a name="inherent-dangers-of-deserialization">Inherent Dangers of Deserialization</a></h3>

<p>Deserializing untrusted data, especially from an unknown,
untrusted, or unauthenticated client, is an inherently dangerous
activity because the content of the incoming data stream
determines the objects that are created, the values of their
fields, and the references between them. By careful construction
of the stream, an adversary can run code in arbitrary classes
with malicious intent.</p>

<p>For example, if object construction has side effects that
change state or invoke other actions, then those actions can
compromise the integrity of application objects, library objects,
and even the Java runtime. "Gadget classes," which can perform
arbitrary reflective actions such as create classes and invoke
methods on them, can be deserialized maliciously to cause a
denial of service or remote code execution.</p>

<p>The key to disabling deserialization attacks is to prevent
instances of arbitrary classes from being deserialized, thereby
preventing the direct or indirect execution of their methods. You
can do this through serialization filters.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="java-serialization-and-deserialization-overview">Java Serialization and Deserialization Overview</a></h3>

<p>An object is serialized when its state is converted to a byte
stream. That stream can be sent to a file, to a database, or over
a network. A Java object is serializable if its class or any of
its superclasses implements either the
<code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface or the
<code>java.io.Externalizable</code> subinterface. In the JDK,
serialization is used in many areas, including Remote Method
Invocation (RMI), custom RMI for interprocess communication (IPC)
protocols (such as the Spring HTTP invoker), and Java Management
Extensions (JMX).</p>

<p>An object is deserialized when its serialized form is
converted to a copy of the object. It is important to ensure the
security of this conversion. Deserialization is code execution
because the <code>readObject</code> method of the class that is
being deserialized can contain custom code.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="serialization-filters">Serialization Filters</a></h3>

<p>A serialization filter enables you to specify which classes
are acceptable to an application and which should be rejected.
Filters also enable you to control the object graph size and
complexity during deserialization so that the object graph
doesn't exceed reasonable limits. You can configure filters as
properties or implement them programmatically.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A serialization filter is not enabled
or configured by default. Serialization filtering doesn't occur
unless you have specified the filter in a system property or a
Security Property or set it with the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> class.</p>

<p>Besides creating filters, you can take the following actions
to help prevent deserialization vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not deserialize untrusted data.</li>
<li>Use SSL to encrypt and authenticate the connections between
applications.</li>
<li>Validate field values before assignment, for example,
checking object invariants by using the <code>readObject</code>
method.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Built-in filters are provided for RMI.
However, you should use these built-in filters as starting points
only. Configure reject-lists and/or extend the allow-list to add
additional protection for your application that uses RMI. See
Built-in Filters.</p>

<p>For more information about these and other strategies, see
"Serialization and Deserialization" in <a href=

<!-- class="section" -->


<h2><a name="java-serialization-filters">Java Serialization Filters</a></h2>

<p>The Java serialization filtering mechanism screens incoming
streams of serialized objects to help improve security and
robustness. Filters can validate incoming instances of classes
before they are deserialized.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290">JEP
290</a> and <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290">JEP
415</a>, the goals of the Java serialization filtering mechanism
are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Provide a way to narrow the classes that can be deserialized
down to a context-appropriate set of classes.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Provide metrics to the filter for graph size and complexity
during deserialization to validate normal graph behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Allow RMI-exported objects to validate the classes expected in
invocations.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two kinds of filters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JVM-wide filter</strong>: Is applied to every
deserialization in the JVM. However, whether and how a JVM-wide
filter validates classes in a particular deserialization depends
on how it's combined with other filters.</li>
<li><strong>Stream-specific filter</strong>: Validates classes
from one specific <code>ObjectInputStream</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can implement a serialization filter in the following
ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Specify a JVM-wide, pattern-based filter with the
<code>jdk.serialFilter</code> property</strong>: A pattern-based
filter consists of a sequence of patterns that can accept or
reject the name of specific classes, packages, or modules. It can
place limits on array sizes, graph depth, total references, and
stream size. A typical use case is to add classes that have been
identified as potentially compromising the Java runtime to a
reject-list. If you specify a pattern-based filter with the
<code>jdk.serialFilter</code> property, then you don't have to
modify your application.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Implement a custom or pattern-based stream-specific
filter with the <code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> API</strong>: You
can implement a filter with the <code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code>
API, which you then set on an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> with the method <code>ObjectInputFilter.Config.setObjectInputFilter(ObjectInputStream, ObjectInputFilter)</code>. You
can create a pattern-based filter with the
<code>ObjectInputFilter</code> API by calling the
<code>Config.createFilter(String)</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> interface is the same as the
<code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/ObjectInputFilter.html">
ObjectInputFilter</a></code> interface in JDK 11 except that it's in the <code>sun.misc</code> package.</p>


</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A serialization filter is not enabled
or configured by default. Serialization filtering doesn't occur
unless you have specified the filter in a system property or a
Security Property or set it with the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> class.</p>

<p>For every new object in the stream, the filter mechanism
applies only one filter to it. However, this filter might be a
combination of filters.</p>

<p>In most cases, a stream-specific filter should check if a
JVM-wide filter is set, especially if you haven't specified a
filter factory. If a JVM-wide filter does exist, then the
stream-specific filter should invoke it and use the JVM-wide
filter's result unless the status is <code>UNDECIDED</code>.</p>


<h2><a name="filter-factories">Filter Factories</a></h2>

<p>A filter factory selects, chooses, or combines filters into a
single filter to be used for a stream. When you specify one, a
deserialization operation uses it when it encounters a class for
the first time to determine whether to allow it. (Subsequent
instances of the same class aren't filtered.) It's implemented as
a <code>BinaryOperator&lt;sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter&gt;</code> and
specified in a system or Security property; see Setting a Filter
Factory. Whenever an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> is created,
the filter factory selects an <code>ObjectInputFilter</code>.
However, you can have a different filter created based on the
characteristics of the stream and the filter that the filter
factory previously created.</p>


<h2><a name="allow-lists-and-reject-lists">Allow-Lists and Reject-Lists</a></h2>

<p>Allow-lists and reject-lists can be implemented using
pattern-based filters or custom filters. These lists allow you to
take proactive and defensive approaches to protect your
applications.</p>

<p>The proactive approach uses allow-lists to allow only class
names that are recognized and trusted and to reject all others.
You can implement allow-lists in your code when you develop your
application, or later by defining pattern-based filters. If your
application only deals with a small set of classes then this
approach can work very well. You can implement allow-lists by
specifying the names of classes, packages, or modules that are
allowed.</p>

<p>The defensive approach uses reject-lists to reject instances
of classes that are not trusted. Usually, reject-lists are
implemented after an attack that reveals that a class is a
problem. A class name can be added to a reject-list, without a
code change, by adding it to a pattern-based filter that's
specified in the <code>jdk.serialFilter</code> property.</p>


<h2><a name="creating-pattern-based-filters">Creating Pattern-Based Filters</a></h2>

<p>Pattern-based filters are filters that you define without
changing your application code. You add JVM-wide filters in
properties files or application-specific filters on the
<code>java</code> command line.</p>

<p>A pattern-based filter is a sequence of patterns. Each pattern
is matched against the name of a class in the stream or a
resource limit. Class-based and resource limit patterns can be
combined in one filter string, with each pattern separated by a
semicolon (;).</p>


<h3><a name="pattern-based-filter-syntax">Pattern-based Filter Syntax</a></h3>
When you create a filter that is composed of patterns, use the
following guidelines:

<ul>
<li>

<p>Separate patterns by semicolons. For example:</p>

<p><code>pattern1.*;pattern2.*</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>White space is significant and is considered part of the
pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Put the limits first in the string. They are evaluated first
regardless of where they are in the string, so putting them first
reinforces the ordering. Otherwise, patterns are evaluated from
left to right.</p>
</li>
<li>A class name that matches a pattern that is preceded by
<code>!</code> is rejected. A class name that matches a pattern
without <code>!</code> is allowed. The following filter rejects
<code>pattern1.MyClass</code> but allows
<code>pattern2.MyClass</code>:

<p><code>!pattern1.*;pattern2.*</code></p>
</li>
<li>Use the wildcard symbol (<code>*</code>) to represent
unspecified class names in a pattern as shown in the following
examples:

<ul>
<li>

<p>To match every class name, use <code>*</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>To match every class name in <code>mypackage</code>, use
<code>mypackage.*</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>To match every class name in <code>mypackage</code> and its
subpackages, use <code>mypackage.**</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>To match every class name that starts with <code>text</code>,
use <code>text*</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If a class name doesn't match any filter, then it is allowed.
If you want to allow only certain class names, then your filter
must reject everything that doesn't match. To reject all class
names other than those specified, include <code>!*</code> as the
last pattern in a class filter.</p>

<p>For a complete description of the syntax for the patterns, see
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290">JEP 290</a>.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="pattern-based-filter-limitations">Pattern-Based Filter Limitations</a></h3>

<p>The following are some of the limitations of pattern-based
filters:</p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>Patterns can't allow different sizes of arrays based on the
class name.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Patterns can't match classes based on the supertype or
interfaces of the class name.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Patterns have no state and can't make choices depending on the
class instances deserialized earlier in the stream.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A pattern-based filter doesn't check
interfaces that are implemented by classes being deserialized.
The filter is invoked for interfaces explicitly referenced in the
stream; it isn't invoked for interfaces implemented by classes
for objects being deserialized.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="define-a-pattern-based-filter-for-one-application">Define a Pattern-Based Filter for One Application</a></h3>

<p>You can define a pattern-based filter as a system property for
one application. A system property supersedes a Security Property
value.</p>

<p>To create a filter that only applies to one application, and
only to a single invocation of Java, define the
<code>jdk.serialFilter</code> system property in the command
line.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to limit resource usage for an
individual application:</p>

<p><code>java
-Djdk.serialFilter=maxarray=100000;maxdepth=20;maxrefs=500??com.example.test.Application</code>
<!-- class="section" --></p>


<h3><a name="define-a-pattern-based-filter-for-all-applications">Define a Pattern-Based Filter for All Applications</a></h3>

<p>You can define a pattern-based, JVM-wide filter that affects
every application run with a Java runtime from
<code>$JAVA_HOME</code> by specifying it as a Security Property.
(Note that a system property supersedes a Security Property
value.) Edit the file
<code>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security</code> and add the
pattern-based filter to the <code>jdk.serialFilter</code>
Security Property.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="define-a-class-filter">Define a Class Filter</a></h3>

<p>You can create a pattern-based class filter that is applied
globally. For example, the pattern might be a class name or a
package with wildcard.</p>
In the following example, the filter rejects one class name from
a package (<code>!example.somepackage.SomeClass</code>), and
allows all other class names in the package:

<p>
<code>jdk.serialFilter=!example.somepackage.SomeClass;example.somepackage.*;</code>
The previous example filter allows all other class names, not
just those in <code>example.somepackage.*</code>. To reject all
other class names, add <code>!*</code>:</p>

<p>
<code>jdk.serialFilter=!example.somepackage.SomeClass;example.somepackage.*;<strong>!*</strong></code>
<!-- class="section" --></p>


<h3><a name="define-a-resource-limit-filter">Define a Resource Limit Filter</a></h3>
A resource filter limits graph complexity and size. You can
create filters for the following parameters to control the
resource usage for each application:

<ul>
<li>

<p>Maximum allowed array size. For example:
<code>maxarray=100000;</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Maximum depth of a graph. For example:
<code>maxdepth=20;</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Maximum references in a graph between objects. For example:
<code>maxrefs=500;</code></p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Maximum number of bytes in a stream. For example:
<code>maxbytes=500000;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h2><a name="creating-custom-filters">Creating Custom Filters</a></h2>

<p>Custom filters are filters you specify in your application's
code. They are set on an individual stream or on all streams in a
process. You can implement a custom filter as a pattern, a
method, a lambda expression, or a class.</p>

<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="reading-a-stream-of-serialized-objects">Reading a Stream of Serialized Objects</a></h3>

<p>You can set a custom filter on one
<code>ObjectInputStream</code>, or, to apply the same filter to
every stream, set a JVM-wide filter. If an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> doesn't have a filter defined for
it, the JVM-wide filter is called, if there is one.</p>

<p>While the stream is being decoded, the following actions
occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each new object in the stream and before the object is
instantiated and deserialized, the filter is called when it
encounters a class for the first time. (Subsequent instances of
the same class aren't filtered.)</li>
<li>For each class in the stream, the filter is called with the
resolved class. It is called separately for each supertype and
interface in the stream.</li>
<li>The filter can examine each class referenced in the stream,
including the class of objects to be created, supertypes of those
classes, and their interfaces.</li>
<li>For each array in the stream, whether it is an array of
primitives, array of strings, or array of objects, the filter is
called with the array class and the array length.</li>
<li>For each reference to an object already read from the stream,
the filter is called so it can check the depth, number of
references, and stream length. The depth starts at??1??and
increases for each nested object and decreases when each nested
call returns.</li>
<li>The filter is not called for primitives or for
<code>java.lang.String</code> instances that are encoded
concretely in the stream.</li>
<li>The filter returns a status of accept, reject, or
undecided.</li>
<li>Filter actions are logged if logging is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless a filter rejects the object, the object is
accepted.</p>


<h3><a name="setting-a-custom-filter-for-an-individual-stream">Setting a Custom Filter for an Individual Stream</a></h3>

<p>You can set a filter on an individual
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> when the input to the stream is
untrusted and the filter has a limited set of classes or
constraints to enforce. For example, you could ensure that a
stream only contains numbers, strings, and other
application-specified types.</p>

<p>A custom filter is set using the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter.Config.setObjectInputFilter(ObjectInputStream, ObjectInputFilter)</code> method. The custom filter must
be set before objects are read from the stream.</p>

<p>In the following example, the
<code>setObjectInputFilter</code> method is invoked with the
<code>dateTimeFilter</code> method. This filter only accepts
classes from the <code>java.time</code> package. The
<code>dateTimeFilter</code> method is defined in a code sample in
<a href="#setting-a-custom-filter-as-a-method">Setting a Custom Filter as a Method</a>.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">LocalDateTime readDateTime(InputStream is) throws IOException {
    try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is)) {
        ObjectInputFilter.Config.setObjectInputFilter(ois, FilterClass::dateTimeFilter);
        return (LocalDateTime) ois.readObject();
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {
        IOException ioe = new StreamCorruptedException("class missing");
        ioe.initCause(ex);
        throw ioe;
    }
}</pre>

<h3><a name="setting-a-jvm-wide-custom-filter">Setting a JVM-Wide Custom Filter</a></h3>

<p>You can set a JVM-wide filter that applies to every use of
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> unless it is overridden on a
specific stream. If you can identify every type and condition
that is needed by the entire application, the filter can allow
those and reject the rest. Typically, JVM-wide filters are used
to reject specific classes or packages, or to limit array sizes,
graph depth, or total graph size.</p>

<p>A JVM-wide filter is set once using the methods of the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter.Config</code> class. The filter can be an
instance of a class, a lambda expression, a method reference, or
a pattern.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">ObjectInputFilter filter = ...
ObjectInputFilter.Config.setSerialFilter(filter);</pre>

<p>In the following example, the JVM-wide filter is set by using
a lambda expression.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">ObjectInputFilter.Config.setSerialFilter( info -&gt;
    info.depth() &gt; 10 ? Status.REJECTED : Status.UNDECIDED);</pre>

<p>In the following example, the JVM-wide filter is set by using
a method reference:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">ObjectInputFilter.Config.setSerialFilter(FilterClass::dateTimeFilter);</pre>


<h3><a name="setting-a-custom-filter-using-a-pattern">Setting a Custom Filter Using a Pattern</a></h3>

<p>A pattern-based custom filter, which is convenient for simple
cases, can be created by using the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter</code> method. You
can create a pattern-based filter as a system property or
Security Property. Implementing a pattern-based filter as a
method or a lambda expression gives you more flexibility.</p>

<p>The filter patterns can accept or reject specific names of
classes, packages, and modules and can place limits on array
sizes, graph depth, total references, and stream size. Patterns
cannot match the names of the supertype or interfaces of the
class.</p>
In the following example, the filter allows
<code>example.File</code> and rejects
<code>example.Directory</code>.

<pre class="codeblock">ObjectInputFilter filesOnlyFilter =
    ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter("example.File;!example.Directory");</pre>
    
    
<p>This example allows only <code>example.File</code>. All other
class names are rejected.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">ObjectInputFilter filesOnlyFilter =
    ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter("example.File;!*");</pre>


<h3><a name="setting-a-custom-filter-as-a-class">Setting a Custom Filter as a Class</a></h3>

<p>A custom filter can be implemented as a class implementing the
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> interface, as a lambda
expression, or as a method.</p>

<p>A filter is typically stateless and performs checks solely on
the input parameters.?? However, you may implement a filter that,
for example, maintains state between calls to the
<code>checkInput</code> method to count artifacts in the
stream.</p>

<p>In the following example, the <code>FilterNumber</code> class
allows any object that is an instance of the <code>Number</code>
class and rejects all others.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">    class FilterNumber implements ObjectInputFilter {
        public Status checkInput(FilterInfo filterInfo) {
            Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = filterInfo.serialClass();
            if (clazz != null) {
                return (Number.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz))
                    ? ObjectInputFilter.Status.ALLOWED
                    : ObjectInputFilter.Status.REJECTED;
            }
            return ObjectInputFilter.Status.UNDECIDED;
        }
    }</pre>

<p>In the example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>checkInput</code> method accepts an
<code>ObjectInputFilter.FilterInfo</code> object.??The object's
methods provide access to the class to be checked, array size,
current depth, number of references to existing objects, and
stream size read so far.</li>
<li>If <code>serialClass</code> is not null, then the value is
checked to see if the class of the object is <code>Number</code>.
If so, it is accepted and returns
<code>ObjectInputFilter.Status.ALLOWED</code>. Otherwise, it is
rejected and returns
<code>ObjectInputFilter.Status.REJECTED</code>.</li>
<li>Any other combination of arguments returns
<code>ObjectInputFilter.Status.UNDECIDED</code>. Deserialization
continues, and any remaining filters are run until the object is
accepted or rejected. If there are no other filters, the object
is accepted.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="setting-a-custom-filter-as-a-method">Setting a Custom Filter as a Method</a></h3>

<p>A custom filter can also be implemented as a method. The
method reference is used instead of an inline lambda
expression.</p>

<p>The <code>dateTimeFilter</code> method that is defined in the
following example is used by the code sample in <a href="#setting-a-custom-filter-for-an-individual-stream">Setting a Custom Filter for an Individual Stream</a>.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">    public class FilterClass {
        static ObjectInputFilter.Status dateTimeFilter(ObjectInputFilter.FilterInfo info) {
            Class&lt;?&gt; serialClass = info.serialClass();

<h2><a name="setting-a-filter-factory">Setting a Filter Factory</a></h2>

<p>A filter factory is a <code>BinaryOperator</code>, which is a
function of two operands that chooses the filter for a stream.
You set a filter factory by specifying its class name in the
system property <code>jdk.serialFilterFactory</code> or in the
Security Property <code>jdk.serialFilterFactory</code>.</p>


<h3><a name="creating-a-filter-factory">Creating a Filter Factory</a></h3>

<p>The sample code <a href="BasicFilterFactory.java"><code>BasicFilterFactory.java</code></a> is a simple example of a filter factory. It
prints its <code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter</code> parameters every time
its <code>apply</code> method is invoked, then returns an
<code>ObjectInputFilter</code> that consists of the
<code>apply</code> method's parameters merged into one
filter.</p>

<p>When you set a filter factory, the filter factory's method
<code>BinaryOperator&lt;ObjectInputFilter&gt;.apply(sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter
t, sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter u)</code> will be invoked when an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> is constructed and when a
stream-specific filter is set on an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code>. The parameter <code>t</code> is
the current filter and <code>u</code> is the requested filter.
When <code>apply</code> is first invoked, <code>t</code> will be
null. If a JVM-wide filter has been set, then when
<code>apply</code> is first invoked, <code>u</code> will be the
JVM-wide filter. Otherwise, <code>u</code> will be null. The
<code>apply</code> method (which you must implement yourself)
returns the filter to be used for the stream. If
<code>apply</code> is invoked again, then the parameter
<code>t</code> will be this returned filter. When you set a
filter with the method
<code>sun.misc.ObjectInputFilter.Config.setObjectInputFilter(ObjectInputStrea, ObjectInputFilter)</code>,
then parameter <code>u</code> will be this filter.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To protect against unexpected
deserializations, ensure that security experts thoroughly review
how your filter factories select and combine filters.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="specifying-a-filter-factory-in-a-system-or-security-property">
Specifying a Filter Factory in a System or Security
Property</a></h3>

<p>You can set a filter factory that applies to only one
application and to only a single invocation of Java by specifying
it in the <code>jdk.serialFilterFactory</code> system property in
the command line:</p>

<p><code>java
-Djdk.serialFilterFactory=<em>FilterFactoryClassName</em>
<em>YourApplication</em></code></p>

<p>The value of <code>jdk.serialFilterFactory</code> is the fully
qualified class name of the filter factory to be set before the
first deserialization. The class must be public and accessible to
the application class loader (which the method
<code><a href="../../../../api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getSystemClassLoader--">java.lang.ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()</a></code> returns).</p>

<p>You can set a JVM-wide filter factory that affects every
application run with a Java runtime from <code>$JAVA_HOME</code>
by specifying it in a Security Property. Note that a system
property supersedes a Security Property value. Edit the file
<code>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security</code> and specify
the filter factory's class name in the
<code>jdk.serialFilterFactory</code> Security Property.</p>

<p>The sample code <a href="TestBasicFilter.java"><code>TestBasicFilter.java</code></a> demonstrates the filter factory
<code>BasicFilterFactory</code>.</p>

<p>Run <code>TestBasicFilter</code> with the following
command:</p>

<p><code>java -Djdk.serialFilterFactory=BasicFilterFactory
TestBasicFilter</code></p>

<p>This command prints output similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">Current filter: null
Requested filter: example.*;java.lang.*;!*
Current filter: example.*;java.lang.*;!*
Requested filter: TestBasicFilter$FilterNumber@7cca494b
Read obj: 42</pre>


<p>The <code>apply</code> method is invoked twice: when the
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> <code>ois</code> is created and
when the method <code>ObjectInputFilter.Config.setObjectInputFilter(ObjectInputStream, ObjectInputFilter)</code> is called.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can set a filter on an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> only once. An
<code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown otherwise. 
<!-- class="section" --></p>


<h2><a name="built-in-filters">Built-in Filters</a></h2>

<p>The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Registry, the RMI
Distributed Garbage Collector, and Java Management Extensions
(JMX) all have filters that are included in the JDK. You should
specify your own filters for the RMI Registry and the RMI
Distributed Garbage Collector to add additional protection.</p>


<h3><a name="filters-for-rmi-registry">Filters for RMI Registry</a></h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use these built-in filters as starting
points only. Edit the
<code>sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter</code> system property to
configure reject-lists and/or extend the allow-list to add
additional protection for the RMI Registry. To protect the whole
application, add the patterns to the
<code>jdk.serialFilter</code> global system property to increase
protection for other serialization users that do not have their
own custom filters.</p>

<p>The RMI Registry has a built-in allow-list filter that allows
objects to be bound in the registry. It includes instances of the
<code>java.rmi.Remote</code>, <code>java.lang.Number</code>,
<code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>,
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRef</code>,
<code>java.rmi.server.UID</code>,
<code>java.rmi.server.RMIClientSocketFactory</code>, and
<code>java.rmi.server.RMIServerSocketFactory</code> classes.</p>
The built-in filter includes size limits:??

<p><code>maxarray=1000000;maxdepth=20</code></p>

<p>Supersede the built-in filter by defining a filter using the
<code>sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter</code> system property with
a pattern. If the filter that you define either accepts classes
passed to the filter, or rejects classes or sizes, the built-in
filter is not invoked.?? If your filter does not accept or reject
anything, the built-filter is invoked.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="filters-for-rmi-distributed-garbage-collector">Filters for RMI Distributed Garbage Collector</a></h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use these built-in filters as starting
points only. Edit the <code>sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter</code>
system property to configure reject-lists and/or extend the
allow-list to add additional protection for Distributed Garbage
Collector. To protect the whole application, add the patterns to
the <code>jdk.serialFilter</code> global system property to
increase protection for other serialization users that do not
have their own custom filters.</p>

<p>The RMI Distributed Garbage Collector has a built-in
allow-list filter that accepts a limited set of classes. It
includes instances of the <code>java.rmi.server.ObjID</code>,
<code>java.rmi.server.UID</code>, <code>java.rmi.dgc.VMID</code>,
and <code>java.rmi.dgc.Lease</code> classes.</p>
The built-in filter includes size limits:??

<p><code>maxarray=1000000;maxdepth=20</code></p>

<p>Supersede the built-in filter by defining a filter using the
<code>sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter</code> system property with a
pattern. If the filter accepts classes passed to the filter, or
rejects classes or sizes, the built-in filter is not invoked.?? If
the superseding filter does not accept or reject anything, the
built-filter is invoked.</p>
<!-- class="section" -->


<h3><a name="filters-for-jmx">Filters for JMX</a></h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use these built-in filters as starting
points only. Edit the
<code>jmx.remote.rmi.server.serial.filter.pattern</code>
management property to configure reject-lists and/or extend the
allow-list to add additional protection for JMX. To protect the
whole application, add the patterns to the
<code>jdk.serialFilter</code> global system property to increase
protection for other serialization users that do not have their
own custom filters.</p>

<p>JMX has a built-in filter to limit a set of classes allowed to
be sent as a deserializing parameters over RMI to the server.
That filter is disabled by default. To enable the filter, define
the <code>jmx.remote.rmi.server.serial.filter.pattern</code>
management property with a pattern.</p>

<p>The pattern must include the types that are allowed to be sent
as parameters over RMI to the server and all types they depends
on, plus <code>javax.management.ObjectName</code> and
<code>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</code> types. For example, to
limit the allowed set of classes to Open MBean types and the
types they depend on, add the following line to
<code>management.properties</code> file.</p>

<p>
<code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.serial.filter.pattern=java.lang.*;java.math.BigInteger;java.math.BigDecimal;java.util.*;javax.management.openmbean.*;javax.management.ObjectName;java.rmi.MarshalledObject;!*</code>
<!-- class="section" --></p>


<h2><a name="logging-filter-actions">Logging Filter Actions</a></h2>

<p>You can turn on logging to record the initialization,
rejections, and acceptances of calls to serialization filters.
Use the log output as a diagnostic tool to see what's being
deserialized, and to confirm your settings when you configure
allow-lists and reject-lists.</p>

<p>When logging is enabled, filter actions are logged to the
<code>java.io.serialization</code> logger.</p>

<p>To enable serialization filter logging, edit the
<code>$JDK_HOME/conf/logging.properties</code> file.</p>

<p>To log calls that are rejected, add</p>

<p><code>java.io.serialization.level = FINE</code></p>

<p>To log all filter results, add</p>

<p><code>java.io.serialization.level = FINEST</code></p>
