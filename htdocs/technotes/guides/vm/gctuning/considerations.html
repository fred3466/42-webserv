<p>This section covers other situations that affect garbage collection.</p>

<h2>Finalization and Weak, Soft, and Phantom References</h2>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<p>Some applications interact with garbage collection by using finalization and weak, soft, or phantom references.</p>

<p>However, the use of finalization is discouraged. It can lead to problems with security,
performance, and reliability. For instance, relying on finalization to close file
descriptors makes an external resource (descriptors) dependent on garbage collection
promptness.</p>

<h3>Finalization</h3>

<p>A class can declare a finalizer &ndash; the method <code>protected void finalize()</code> &ndash; whose body releases any underlying resources. The GC will
schedule the finalizer of an unreachable object, which is called before the GC reclaims the
object's memory.</p>

<p>An object becomes unreachable, and thus eligible for garbage collection, when there's
no path from a GC root to the object. (See <a href="#reference-object-types">Reference-Object Types</a>
for more information about reachability.) GC roots include references from an active thread
and internal JVM references; they are the references that keep objects in memory. </p>

<p>See <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/memleaks004.html#CIHCDBJB">Monitor the Objects Pending Finalization</a>
in <em>Java Platform, Standard Edition Troubleshooting Guide</em> to determine if
finalizable objects are building up in your system. In addition, you can use one
of these tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JDK Mission Control:
    <ol>
      <li>In the <strong>JVM Browser</strong>, right-click your JVM and select
        <strong>Start JMX Console</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>MBean Browser</strong>, in the
        <strong>MBean Tree</strong>, expand <strong>java.lang</strong> and
        select <strong>Memory</strong>.</li>
      <li>In <strong>MBean Features</strong>, the attribute
        <strong>ObjectPendingFinalizationCount</strong> is the approximate
        number of objects that are pending finalization.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><p><code>jcmd</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following command to print information about the Java
          finalization queue; the value <code><em>&lt;pid&gt;</em></code> is the
          PID of your JVM:</p>
        <p><code>jcmd <em>&lt;pid&gt;</em> GC.finalizer_info</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>  
  				 
<h3>Migrating from Finalization</h3>

<p>To avoid finalization, use the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement. This is a <code>try</code> statement
that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after
the program is finished with it. The <code>try</code>-with-resources statement
ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the code block, even if one or more
exceptions occur. See <a href="https://dev.java/learn/catching-and-handling-exceptions/#anchor_6">The Try-with-resources Statement</a> for more
information.</p>

<h3><a name="reference-object-types">Reference-Object Types</a></h3>

<p>There are three reference-object types: <code>SoftReference</code>,
<code>WeakReference</code>, and <code>PhantomReference</code>. Each
reference-object type corresponds to a different level of reachability. The following are
the different levels of reachability, from strongest to weakest, which reflect the life
cycle of an object:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An object is <em>strongly reachable</em> if it can be reached by some thread without
    traversing any reference objects. A newly-created object is strongly reachable by
    the thread that created it.</li>

  <li>An object is <em>softly reachable</em> if it is not strongly reachable but can be
    reached by traversing a soft reference.</li>
	
  <li>An object is <em>weakly reachable</em> if it is neither strongly nor softly reachable
    but can be reached by traversing a weak reference. When the weak references to a
    weakly-reachable object are cleared, the object becomes eligible for
    finalization.</li>
	
  <li>An object is <em>phantom reachable</em> if it is neither strongly, softly, nor weakly
    reachable, it has been finalized, and some phantom reference refers to it.</li>

  <li>An object is <em>unreachable</em>, and therefore eligible for reclamation, when it is
    not reachable in any of the previous ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each reference-object type encapsulates a single reference to a particular object, which
is called the <em>referent</em>. A reference object provides methods for clearing the
referent.</p>

<p>The following are the most common uses for reference-object instances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To maintain access to an object while still allowing it to be garbage collected if
    the system needs to free up memory (such as a cached value that can be regenerated
    if required)</li>
	
  <li>To determine and perhaps take some action when an object has reached a particular
    reachability level (in combination with the <code>ReferenceQueue</code>
    class)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explicit Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>Another way that applications can interact with garbage collection is by invoking full garbage collections explicitly by calling <code dir="ltr">System.gc()</code>. This can force a major collection to be done when it may not be necessary (for example, when a minor collection would suffice), and so in general should be avoided. The performance effect of explicit garbage collections can be measured by disabling them using the flag <code dir="ltr">-XX:+DisableExplicitGC</code>, which causes the VM to ignore calls to <code dir="ltr">System.gc()</code>.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly encountered uses of explicit garbage collection occurs with the distributed garbage collection (DGC) of Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Applications using RMI refer to objects in other virtual machines. Garbage cannot be collected in these distributed applications without occasionally invoking garbage collection of the local heap, so RMI forces full collections periodically. The frequency of these collections can be controlled with properties, as in the following example:</p>
<pre dir="ltr" xml:space="preserve">
java -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000
    -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 ...
</pre>
<p>This example specifies explicit garbage collection once per hour instead of the default rate of once per minute. However, this may also cause some objects to take much longer to be reclaimed. These properties can be set as high as <code dir="ltr">Long.MAX_VALUE</code> to make the time between explicit collections effectively infinite if there is no desire for an upper bound on the timeliness of DGC activity.</p>
</div>

<div><a id="sthref65" name="sthref65"/>
<h2>Soft References</h2>
<p>Soft references are kept alive longer in the server virtual machine than in the client. The rate of clearing can be controlled with the command-line option <code dir="ltr">-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=</code><code dir="ltr"><span>&lt;N&gt;</span></code>, which specifies the number of milliseconds (ms) a soft reference will be kept alive (once it is no longer strongly reachable) for each megabyte of free space in the heap. The default value is 1000 ms per megabyte, which means that a soft reference will survive (after the last strong reference to the object has been collected) for 1 second for each megabyte of free space in the heap. This is an approximate figure because soft references are cleared only during garbage collection, which may occur sporadically.</p>
</div>

<div><a id="sthref66" name="sthref66"/>
<h2>Class Metadata</h2>
<p>Java classes have an internal representation within Java Hotspot VM and are referred to as class metadata. In previous releases of Java Hotspot VM, the class metadata was allocated in the so called permanent generation. In JDK 8, the permanent generation was removed and the class metadata is allocated in native memory. The amount of native memory that can be used for class metadata is by default unlimited. Use the option <code dir="ltr">MaxMetaspaceSize</code> to put an upper limit on the amount of native memory used for class metadata.</p>
<p>Java Hotspot VM explicitly manages the space used for metadata. Space is requested from the OS and then divided into chunks. A class loader allocates space for metadata from its chunks (a chunk is bound to a specific class loader). When classes are unloaded for a class loader, its chunks are recycled for reuse or returned to the OS. Metadata uses space allocated by <code dir="ltr">mmap</code>, not by <code dir="ltr">malloc</code>.</p>
<p>If <code dir="ltr">UseCompressedOops</code> is turned on and <code dir="ltr">UseCompressedClassesPointers</code> is used, then two logically different areas of native memory are used for class metadata. <code dir="ltr">UseCompressedClassPointers</code> uses a 32-bit offset to represent the class pointer in a 64-bit process as does <code dir="ltr">UseCompressedOops</code> for Java object references. A region is allocated for these compressed class pointers (the 32-bit offsets). The size of the region can be set with <code dir="ltr">CompressedClassSpaceSize</code> and is 1 gigabyte (GB) by default. The space for the compressed class pointers is reserved as space allocated by <code dir="ltr">mmap</code> at initialization and committed as needed. The <code dir="ltr">MaxMetaspaceSize</code> applies to the sum of the committed compressed class space and the space for the other class metadata.</p>
<p>Class metadata is deallocated when the corresponding Java class is unloaded. Java classes are unloaded as a result of garbage collection, and garbage collections may be induced in order to unload classes and deallocate class metadata. When the space committed for class metadata reaches a certain level (a high-water mark), a garbage collection is induced. After the garbage collection, the high-water mark may be raised or lowered depending on the amount of space freed from class metadata. The high-water mark would be raised so as not to induce another garbage collection too soon. The high-water mark is initially set to the value of the command-line option <code dir="ltr">MetaspaceSize</code>. It is raised or lowered based on the options <code dir="ltr">MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio</code> and <code dir="ltr">MinMetaspaceFreeRatio</code>. If the committed space available for class metadata as a percentage of the total committed space for class metadata is greater than <code dir="ltr">MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio</code>, then the high-water mark will be lowered. If it is less than <code dir="ltr">MinMetaspaceFreeRatio</code>, then the high-water mark will be raised.</p>
<p>Specify a higher value for the option <code dir="ltr">MetaspaceSize</code> to avoid early garbage collections induced for class metadata. The amount of class metadata allocated for an application is application-dependent and general guidelines do not exist for the selection of <code dir="ltr">MetaspaceSize</code>. The default size of <code dir="ltr">MetaspaceSize</code> is platform-dependent and ranges from 12 MB to about 20 MB.</p>
<p>Information about the space used for metadata is included in a printout of the heap. A typical output is shown in <a href="#typical_heap_printout">Example 11-1, "Typical Heap Printout"</a>.</p>
