<h2><a name="intro">Introduction to Java Web Start</a></h2>

<p>Java Web Start is an application-deployment technology that enables your 
users to launch full-featured applications with a single click from any web 
browser. Users can download and launch applications without going through 
complicated installation procedures.</p>

<p>With Java Web Start, your users launch applications by clicking a web page 
link. If the application is not present on their computer, Java Web Start 
automatically downloads all necessary files. It then caches the files on the 
computer so that the application is always ready to be relaunched anytime the 
user wants &mdash; either from an icon on the desktop or from the browser link. No 
matter which method is used to launch the application, the most current version 
of the application is always presented.</p>

<p>The technology underlying Java Web Start is the Java Network Launching 
Protocol &amp; API (JNLP). This technology was developed through the Java 
Community Process (JCP). Java Web Start is the reference implementation (RI) for 
the JNLP specification. The JNLP technology defines, among other things, the 
JNLP file, which is a standard file format that describes how to launch an 
application. The JNLP specification is available at <a href=
"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JSR 56: Java Network Launching Protocol and 
API</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="benefits">Benefits of Java Web Start</a></h2>

<p>From a technology standpoint, Java Web Start has a number of key benefits 
that make it an attractive platform to use for deploying applications.</p>
<p>The benefits include the following:</p>
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Java Web Start is built exclusively to launch applications written to the 
Java Platform, Standard Edition. Thus, a single application can be made 
available on a web server and then deployed on a wide variety of platforms, 
including Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Web Start supports multiple revisions of the Java Platform, Standard 
Edition. Thus, an application can request a particular version of the platform 
it requires, such as Java SE 8. Several applications can run at the same time on 
different platform revisions without causing conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Web Start enables applications to be launched independently of a web 
browser. This can be used for off-line operation of an application, where 
launching the application through the browser is inconvenient or impossible. The 
application can also be launched through desktop shortcuts, making launching the 
web-deployed application similar to launching a native application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Web Start takes advantage of security features of the Java Platform. 
Sandbox applications are run in a protective environment with restricted access 
to local disk and network resources. Users must also agree to run the 
application the first time it is launched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications launched with Java Web Start are cached locally. Thus, an 
already-downloaded application is launched similar to a traditionally installed 
application.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="security">Security Considerations</a></h2>

<p>Java Web Start allows you to run code from the internet. Although there are 
mechanisms in place, such as HTTPS, that attempt to validate the provenance of 
code obtained from the internet, it's not always possible to do so. Therefore 
Java Web Start relies on code signing to determine if the code comes from a 
trusted party.</p>

<p>Unsigned code will be rejected, and after signature verification, the user 
will be prompted to determine if the code signer should be trusted. It is very 
important that no unsigned code or code from a nontrusted signer be granted run 
permission. This means that users must pay attention to the security warnings 
and prompts. See <a href="development.html#security">Security and Code Signing
</a>.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="../../deploy/deployment_rules.html">Deployment Rule Set</a> 
(DRS) feature to prevent a user the ability to decide whether a code 
signer should be trusted. Instead, an organization can specify a security policy 
that determines this. Consequently, if your organization uses a DRS, you can 
avoid presenting dialogs to end users. Trusted signers can have their code 
launched without prompts while untrusted and unsigned code can be denied without 
prompts.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="../../deploy/exception_site_list.html">Exception 
Site List</a> feature to provides a way for users to run Rich Internet 
Applications (RIAs) that otherwise would be blocked by security checks. The 
exception site list contains URLs for sites that host RIAs that users want to 
run. RIAs that are launched from sites in the exception site list are allowed to 
run with the appropriate security prompts.</p>

<p>Java Web Start Users should apply all critical patch updates for JRE 8 
(specifically, the JRE version that launches Java Web Start). Turning on 
auto-update can help you keep your JRE up-to-date.</p>

<p>There are alternative providers that can manage Java Web Start applications 
and JNLP, such as IcedTea-Web. Oracle makes no claims as to whether these 
providers perform all the security checks that the JDK performs. If you choose 
to rely on those providers, carefully evaluate them as you would any new 
technology that you plan to run in your systems. Oracle recommends that you 
check that these providers do not allow unsigned code to run and that they 
request user acceptance with information from the signature before trusting 
signed code.</p>

<h2><a name="where" id="where"></a>Where to Find Java Web Start</h2>

<p>Java Web Start is included in the Java Platform, Standard Edition development 
kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and includes the security features 
of the Java platform.</p>

<h2><a name="using" id="using"></a>Using Java Web Start Software</h2>

<p>Java Web Start allows you to launch Java-technology-based
applications directly from the Web. An application can be launched
in three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a Web browser by clicking on a link.</li>
<li>From desktop icons or the Start Menu.</li>
<li>From the Java Cache Viewer</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which way is used, Java Web Start will connect
back to the Web server each time an application is launched to
check whether an updated version of the application is
available.</p>

<h3><a name="launching">Launching from a Web Browser</a></h3>

<p>Point your web browser to a page with a link to a JNLP application, and click 
that link.</p>
<p>A security dialog box will pop up with information about the origin of the 
application based on who digitally signed the code, and the level of access 
requested. The application will run only if you decide to trust the vendor.</p>
<p>That is really all there is to using Java Web Start, but how does it work? 
The HTML links that launch the applications are, in fact, standard HTML links. 
However, instead of pointing to another web page, they link to a special 
configuration file called a JNLP file. The web browser examines the file 
extension or the MIME type of the file, and sees that it belongs to Java Web 
Start. It then launches Java Web Start with the downloaded JNLP file as an 
argument. Java Web Start proceeds with downloading, caching, and running the 
application as directed by the JNLP file.</p>

<h3><a name="launching-desktop">Launching from Desktop Icons and the Start Menu (Microsoft Windows and Linux 
Running GNOME 2.0+)</a></h3>

<p>Java Web Start technology can automatically create shortcuts for your 
application on the desktop and in the Start Menu for web-deployed applications 
developed with Java technology. You can use the Java Control Panel to control 
the shortcut settings. Shortcuts can also be added by using the Java Web Start 
Cache Viewer, using the install shortcut menu item.</p>

<h3><a name="proxy">Using Java Web Start Software Behind a Proxy Server or Firewall</a></h3>

<p>Java Web Start software must be configured with the correct proxy settings 
in order to launch applications from outside your firewall. Java Web Start 
software automatically tries to detect the proxy settings from the default 
browser on your system. Java Web Start technology supports most web proxy 
auto-configuration scripts. It can detect proxy settings in almost all 
environments.</p>

<p>You can also use the Java Web Start Control Panel to view or
edit the proxy configuration. Refer to the <a href="../../deploy/jcp.html">
Java Control Panel</a> for more details.</p>
