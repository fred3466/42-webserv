<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction to Web Deployment</h2>

<p>Developing applications for deployment with Java Web Start is generally the 
same as developing standalone applications for the Java Platform, Standard 
Edition. For instance, the entry point for the application is the standard 
<code>public static void main(String[] argv)</code>.</p>
<p>However, to support web deployment &mdash; automatic downloading and launching of 
an application &mdash; and to ensure that an application can run in a secure sandbox, 
there are some additional considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An application must be delivered as a set of signed JAR files. All entries 
in each JAR file must be signed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All application resources, such as files and images, must be stored in JAR 
files. The resources must be referenced using the <code>getResource</code> 
mechanism in the Java Platform, Standard Edition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an application is written to run in a secure sandbox, it must follow 
these restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No access to a local disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All JAR files must be downloaded from the same host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network connections without user prompts are enabled only for the host from 
which the JAR files are downloaded. Connections to other hosts require 
approval from the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No security manager can be installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No native libraries can be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited access to system properties. The application has read/write access 
to all secure system properties defined in the JNLP file, as well as read-only 
access to the same set of properties that an applet has access to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these restrictions can be overcome by the use of the JNLP API to 
access the file system and other system resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application is allowed to use the <code>System.exit</code> call.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="retrieving" id="retrieving"></a>Retrieving Resources
from JAR files</h2>

<p>Java Web Start only transfers JAR files from the Web server to
the client machine. It determines where to store the JAR files on
the local machine. Thus, an application cannot use disk-relative
references to resources such as images and configuration files.</p>

<p>All application resources must be retrieved from the JAR files
specified in the <tt>resources</tt> section of the JNLP file, or
retrieved explicitly using an HTTP request to the Web server.
Storing resources in JAR files is recommended, since they will be
cached on the local machine by Java Web Start.</p>

<p>The following code example shows how to retrieve images from a
JAR file:</p>

<pre style="codeblock">
// Get current classloader
ClassLoader cl = <b>this</b>.getClass().getClassLoader();
// Create icons
Icon saveIcon  = <b>new</b> ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/save.gif"));
Icon cutIcon   = <b>new</b> ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/cut.gif"));
...
</pre>

<p>The example assumes that the following entries exist in one of
the JAR files for the application:</p>

<pre style="codeblock">
images/save.gif
images/cut.gif
</pre>

<h2><a name="jnlpAPI" id="jnlpAPI"></a>Accessing the Client Using
JNLP API</h2>

<p>JNLP API can be used to access the client's file system and
other resources. See the following topics for more information
about using JNLPI API to access the client:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="examples.html">JNLP API Examples</a></li>
<li><a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/doingMoreWithRIA/usingJNLPAPI.html">
Accessing Client the Using JNLP API</a> topic in the <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/index.html">Deployment
Trail</a> of the Java Tutorials. The information for the sample applet also 
applies to Java Web Start applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="security" id="security"></a>Security and Code Signing</h2>

<p>Java Web Start addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protecting users against malicious code (intentional and unintentional) 
that may affect local files</li>
<li>Protecting enterprises against code that may attempt to access or destroy 
data on networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications launched with Java Web Start are, by default, run in a 
restricted environment where they have limited access to local computing 
resources, such as storage devices and the local network.</p>

<p>An additional security feature supported by Java Web Start is digital code 
signing. If an application being invoked is delivered in one or more signed JAR 
files, then Java Web Start will verify that the contents of the JAR file have 
not been modified since they were signed. If verification of a digital 
signature fails, then Java Web Start will not run the application, because it 
might have been compromised by a third party.</p>

<p>The support for code signing is important for both users and for application 
service providers. This service makes it possible for users to verify that an 
application comes from a trusted source. A signed application that is trusted 
by the user can also request additional system privileges, such as access to a 
local disk.</p>

<p>Java Web Start presents a dialog box that displays the application's origin, 
based on the signer's certificate, before the application is launched. This 
enables the user to make an informed decision about whether or not to grant 
additional privileges to the downloaded code.</p>

<p>By including the following settings in the JNLP file, an application can 
request full access to a client system if all its JAR files are signed:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">&lt;<span class="bold">security</span>&gt;
   &lt;<span class="bold">all-permissions</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="bold">security</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>The implementation of code signing in Java Web Start is based on the 
security API in the core Java Platform, Standard Edition.</p>

<p>Developers sign code for use with Java Web Start in the same way as for Java 
applets &mdash; by using the standard <code>jarsigner</code> tool from 
the Java Platform, Standard Edition. The <a href=
"../../../tools/index.html#security"><tt>jarsigner</tt></a> tool documentation 
provides examples of how to sign code and create test certificates, and it 
discusses other issues related to signing.</p>

<h2><a name="signing" id="signing"></a>Signing JAR Files with a
Test Certificate</h2>

<p>For testing purposes, a self-signed certificate can be used to sign a JAR 
file. For production, use a code signing certificate issued by a trusted 
certificate authority.</p>
<p>These are the steps to sign a JAR file with a self-signed test certificate:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the location of the <code>keytool</code> and <code>jarsigner
</code> tools is in your path. These tools are located in the JDK bin directory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new key in a new <code>keystore</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">keytool -genkey -keystore myKeystore -alias myself</pre>
<p>You are prompted for information about the new key, such as password and 
name. This creates the <code>myKeystore</code> file on the disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a self-signed test certificate as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">keytool -selfcert -alias myself -keystore myKeystore</pre>
<p>This prompts for the password. Generating the certificate might take a few 
minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check to ensure that everything is OK. To list the contents of the keystore, 
use this command:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">keytool -list -keystore myKeystore</pre>
<p>The output should look similar to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">Keystore type: jks
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry:

myself, Tue Jan 23 19:29:32 PST 2001, keyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (MD5):
C2:E9:BF:F9:D3:DF:4C:8F:3C:5F:22:9E:AF:0B:42:9D
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Sign the JAR file with the test certificate as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">jarsigner -keystore myKeystore test.jar myself</pre>
<p>Repeat this step with all of your JAR files.</p>
<p>Note that a self-signed test certificate should only be used for internal 
testing, because it does not guarantee the identity of the user and therefore 
cannot be trusted. A trustworthy certificate can be obtained from a certificate 
authority, such as <a href="https://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a> or <a href=
"https://www.thawte.com">Thawte</a>, and should be used when the application is 
put into production.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To run an application that is signed with a self-signed test certificate, do 
one of the following on the computer where the application will run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add the location of the application to the Exception Site List, which is 
managed from the Java Control Panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import the test certificate into the User Signer CA store using the Java 
Control Panel or into the System Signer CA store using the <code>keytool</code> 
utility.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Encode JNLP Files</h2>
<p>Encode JNLP files in any character encoding supported by the Java Platform, Standard Edition. See <a href=
"../../intl/encoding.doc.html">Supported Codings</a> for a list of supported encodings.</p>

<p>To encode a JNLP file, specify an encoding in the XML prolog of
that file. For example, the following line indicates that the JNLP
file will be encoded in UTF-16.</p>

<pre style="codeblock">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?&gt;
</pre>

<p>The XML prolog itself must be UTF-8-encoded.</p>

<h2><a name="dynamic" id="dynamic"></a>Dynamic Download of HTTPS
Certificates</h2>

<p>Java Web Start dynamically imports certificates in a similar way as browsers 
do. To make this work, Java Web Start sets its own HTTPS handler, using the 
<code>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</code> system properties, to initialize 
defaults for <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> and <code>HostnameVerifier</code>. 
It sets the defaults with <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory
</code> and <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier</code>.</p>

<p>If your application uses those two methods, ensure that they are called 
after the Java Web Start HTTPS handler is initialized, otherwise your custom 
handler will be replaced by the Java Web Start default handler. You can ensure 
that your own customized <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> and <code>
HostnameVerifier</code> are used by doing either of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install your own HTTPS handler, which will completely replace the Java Web 
Start HTTPS handler.</li>
<li>Call <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory</code> or <code>
HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier</code> only after the first <code>
HttpsURLConnection</code> object is created, which executes the Java Web Start 
HTTPS handler initialization code first.</li>
</ol>

<p>For information on creating a download servlet, which simplifies the process 
of deploying Java Web Start applications on a web server as well as providing 
enhanced functionality, see <a href="downloadservletguide.html">
