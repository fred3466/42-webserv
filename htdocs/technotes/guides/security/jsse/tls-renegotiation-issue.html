<p>In the fall of 2009, a flaw was discovered in the SSL/TLS
protocols. A fix to the protocol was developed by the IETF TLS
Working Group, and current versions of the JDK contain this fix.
This section describes the situation in much more detail, along
with interoperability issues when communicating with older
implementations that do not contain this protocol fix.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allowed for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
where chosen plain text could be injected as a prefix to a TLS
connection. This vulnerability did not allow an attacker to decrypt
or modify the intercepted network communication once the client and
server have successfully negotiated a session between
themselves.</p>

<p>The fix for this issue was handled in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phase 1: Until a protocol fix could be developed, an interim fix
that disabled SSL/TLS renegotiations by default was made available
in the <a href=

<p>Phase 2: The <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> issued
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5746.txt">RFC 5746</a>, which
addresses the renegotiation protocol flaw. The following table
lists the JDK and JRE releases that include the fix which
implements RFC 5746 and supports secure renegotiation.</p>

configuration. However applications that require renegotiations
(for example, web servers that initially allow for anonymous client
browsing, but later require SSL/TLS authenticated clients):</p>

<h2>Description of the Phase 2 Fix</h2>
<p>The SunJSSE implementation reenables renegotiations by default
for connections to peers compliant with RFC 5746. That is, both the
client and server <strong>must support RFC 5746</strong> in order
to securely renegotiate. SunJSSE provides some interoperability
modes for connections with peers that have not been upgraded, but
users are <strong>strongly encouraged to update both their client
and server implementations as soon as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>With the Phase 2 fix, SunJSSE has three renegotiation
interoperability modes. Each mode fully supports the RFC 5746
secure renegotiation, but has these added semantics when
communicating with a peer that has not been upgraded:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Strict mode</b>: Requires both client and server be upgraded
to RFC 5746 and to send the proper RFC 5746 messages. If not, the
initial (or subsequent) handshaking will fail and the connection
will be terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Interoperable mode (default)</b>: Use of the proper RFC 5746
messages is optional; however, legacy (original SSL/TLS
specifications) renegotiations are disabled if the proper messages
are not used. Initial legacy connections are still allowed, but
legacy renegotiations are disabled. This is the best mix of
security and interoperability, and is the default setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insecure mode</b>: Permits full legacy renegotiation. Most
interoperable with legacy peers but vulnerable to the original MITM
attack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The three mode distinctions only affect a connection with a peer
that has not been upgraded. Ideally, strict (full RFC 5746) mode
should be used for all clients and servers; however, it will take
some time for all deployed SSL/TLS implementations to support RFC
5746, because the interoperable mode is the current default.</p>
<p>The following table contains interoperability information
about the modes for various cases in which the client and/or server
are either updated to support RFC 5746 or not.</p>

<ul>
<li><small><b>TLSv1</b><br />
A warning alert message of type <code>no_renegotiation(100)</code>

<h2><a name="workarounds" id="workarounds">Workarounds and
Alternatives to SSL/TLS Renegotiation</a></h2>
<p>All peers should be updated to RFC 5746-compliant implementation
as soon as possible. Even with this RFC 5746 fix, communications
with peers that have not been upgraded will be affected if a
renegotiation is necessary. Here are a few suggested options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Restructure the peer to not require renegotiation.</b></p>
<p>Renegotiations are typically used by web servers that initially
allow for anonymous client browsing but later require SSL/TLS
authenticated clients, or that may initially allow weak cipher
suites but later need stronger ones. The alternative is to require
client authentication or strong cipher suites during the
<em>initial</em> negotiation. There are a couple of options for
doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an application has a browse mode until a certain point is
reached and a renegotiation is required, then you can restructure
the server to eliminate the browse mode and require all initial
connections be strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break the server into two entities, with the browse mode
occurring on one entity, and using a second entity for the more
secure mode. When the renegotiation point is reached, transfer any
relevant information between the servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these options require a fair amount of work, but will
not reopen the original security flaw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Set renegotiation interoperability mode to "insecure" using
the system properties.</b></p>
<p>See the <a href="#descPhase2">Description of the Phase 2 Fix</a>
for information and warnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ******************************** -->
<h2><a name="implDetails" id="implDetails">Implementation
Details</a></h2>
<p>RFC 5746 defines two new data structures, which are mentioned
here for advanced users:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pseudo-cipher suite called the Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(SCSV), "TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV"</li>
<li>A TLS extension called the Renegotiation Info (RI).</li>
</ul>
<p>Either of these can be used to signal that an implementation is
RFC 5746-compliant and can perform secure renegotiations. For more
relevant technical discussions, see the <a href=
"https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/tls/">IETF
email discussion</a> from November 2009 to February 2010.</p>
<p>RFC 5746 enables clients to send either an SCSV or RI in the
first <code>ClientHello</code>. For maximum interoperability,
SunJSSE uses the SCSV by default, as a few TLS/SSL servers do not
handle unknown extensions correctly. The presence of the SCSV in
the enabled cipher suites
(<code>SSLSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites()</code> or
<code>SSLEngine.setEnabledCipherSuites()</code>) determines whether
the SCSV is sent in the initial <code>ClientHello</code>, or if an
RI should be sent instead.</p>
<p>SSLv2 does not support SSL/TLS extensions. If the
<code>SSLv2Hello</code> protocol is enabled, then the SCSV is sent
in the initial <code>ClientHello</code>.</p>
<!-- ******************************** -->
<h2><a name="descPhase1" id="descPhase1">Description of the Phase 1
fix</a></h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Phase 1 Fix was to disable
renegotiations by default until a fix compliant with RFC 5746 could
be developed. Renegotiations could be reenabled by setting the
<code>sun.security.ssl.allowUnsafeRenegotiation</code> system
property. The Phase 2 fix uses the same
<code>sun.security.ssl.allowUnsafeRenegotiation</code> system
property, but also requires it to use RFC 5746 messages.</p>
<p>All applications should upgrade to the Phase 2 RFC 5746 fix as
soon as possible.</p>
<h2><a name="allowUnsafeCert" id="allowUnsafeCert">Allow Unsafe
Server Certificate Change in SSL/TLS renegotiations</a></h2>
<p>Server certificate change in an SSL/TLS renegotiation may be
unsafe:</p>
<ol>
<li>if endpoint identification is not enabled in an SSL/TLS
handshaking; and</li>
<li>if the previous handshake is a session-resumption abbreviated
initial handshake; and</li>
<li>if the identities represented by both certificates can be
regarded as the same.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two certificates can be considered to represent the same
identity:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the subject alternative names of IP address are present in
both certificates, they should be identical; otherwise,</li>
<li>if the subject alternative names of DNS name are present in
both certificates, they should be identical; otherwise,</li>
<li>if the subject fields are present in both certificates, the
certificate subjects and issuers should be identical.</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting with JDK 8u25, unsafe server certificate change in
SSL/TLS renegotiations is not allowed by default. The new system
property <code>jdk.tls.allowUnsafeServerCertChange</code>, can be
used to define whether unsafe server certificate change in an
SSL/TLS renegotiation should be restricted or not.</p>
<p>The default value of this system property is
<code>"false"</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> DO NOT set the system property to
<code>"true"</code> unless it is really necessary, as this would
re-establish the unsafe server certificate change
vulnerability.</p>
